# Node-chat-application

This is small but full featured chat application. Written in vanilla.js for frontend, and node.js for backend. MongoDB and Redis are used for various data storage. Standard express framework scheme has been used. Sessions are implemented via cookies, with basic auth protocol for authentication. <br>

The application supports creating user accounts, group chat and also single user-to-user messaging. <br>

This project was made just for fun and little bit of practice. Feel free to use it for your own need.

P.S. Didn't spend too much time for styling. :)
